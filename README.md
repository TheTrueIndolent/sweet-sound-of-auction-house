## Category: Addon - Script
## Game: World of Warcraft
Sweet Sound of Auction House (SSoA) is an add on that enchants notifications from the Auction House.

You can open the options panel in three ways.
1. With the commands: /ssoa and /sweetsoundofauctionhouse
2. Through the game menu. Game Menu (Esc) --> Options --> AddOns
3. Through the minimap buttons that Blizzard gave us. It’s a tiny number at the top-left or bottom-left of the minimap, click it and you will find it.

Right now, SSoA lets you choose what kind of notifications you will receive when:
You sell an item at Auction House:
- play the sound of Cash Register Machine or the sound of the Auction House!
- make your character Cheer, Congratulate, or Dance!
- send a notification into your Main Chat Frame! (Sometimes the classic System Notification "Your auction of %s sold" is not shown)
- send a notification into the SSoA Frame!

One of your Auctions expires:
- play the sound of Zong or the sound of Bells!
- make your character Mourn, Mad, or Plays the Smallest Violin!
- send a notification into your Main Chat Frame! (There is no in game notification)
- send a notification into the SSoA Frame!

About the SSoA frame:
- If you want the auction house’s notifications, the loot, the money, and the currencies will be shown in the frame!
- You can hide it or show it!
- You can choose the width and height of the frame!
- You can choose the fonts size!
- You can choose how long the text will be visible!
- You can choose the opacity of the background!
